TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Make sure that bundler is installed.
If

    $ gem list --local

does not show it up, it is not.
In this case, you should install it, probably as root:

    $ sudo gem install bundler

If you then

    $ cd <installation dir>

and execute:

    $ bundle

it will pull in dependencies, namely xmpp4r.

## Usage

Run

    $ bin/swwbot.rb

## Documentation

The bot relies heavily on the xmpp4r gem.
You can find its RDoc at http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/rdoc/.
